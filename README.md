# northwind_Data# SQL Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to work with relational databases using SQL. The goal is to analyze product and sales data by writing queries that answer key business questions. The project involves retrieving, filtering, and aggregating data from a sample database to produce actionable insights.

All queries are written in SQL and can be executed on a PostgreSQL database using PgAdmin4.



## Project Instructions
1. Restore the provided database to your PostgreSQL server using PgAdmin4.  
2. Execute the SQL queries included in this repository to answer the questions below.  
3. Only the SQL scripts (`.sql` files) need to be submitted to run the analysis.



## Project Questions / Tasks

1. Retrieve the **Product Name** and **Quantity per Unit**.  
2. Get the **current product list** (Product ID and Name).  
3. List **Products by Category**.  
4. Retrieve the **discontinued product list** (Product ID and Name).  
5. List the **most expensive and least expensive products** (Name and Unit Price).  
6. List products (ID, Name, Unit Price) where the **current price is less than $20**.  
7. List products (ID, Name, Unit Price) where **price is between $15 and $25**.  
8. List products (Name, Unit Price) with **above-average price**.  
9. List the **ten most expensive products** (Name, Unit Price).  
10. Count the **current and discontinued products**.  
11. List products (Name, Units on Order, Units in Stock) where **stock is less than units on order**.  
12. For each employee, calculate their **total sales amount**.  
13. Return each order and **calculate the sales price after discount**.  
14. For each category, list the products sold and **total sales amount per product**.  
15. Show **sales figures by category for the year 1997** only.
